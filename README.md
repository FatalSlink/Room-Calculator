This is a room painting calculator for a small homework project in college Java 1 week 8.
The program assumes that 1 gallon of paint covers 350^ft of surface, and assumes a very generous price of $32/gallon of paint.
Should be getting updated with color options and more mathematical operations (different shapes, volume, etc) to start.
